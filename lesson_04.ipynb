The vast majority (all?) of DC data is based on the Master Address Repository (or MAR), which lists things in latitudes and longitudes in the WGS84 projection. Be warned when working with these sorts of files that you will potentially run into issues near the poles with Mercator projections, but they should be generally fine around DC.\n",
